vcard2ldap

This project aims to take a vcard export (vcf) as argument, and to populate a
LDAP tree.

Requirements :

Those python packages are needed :

* python-ldap
* python-vobject

Configuration :

Edit the main python file, and change the variables to suit your needs

Feedbacks welcome, I am not at my ease coding in python, so feel free to
propose some improvements to this current piece of code.

Acknowledgements :

A french blogger who gives a piece of code I used as inspiration to use the
python-ldap library. I cannot find back the link for now, but a huge thanks
should go to him.
